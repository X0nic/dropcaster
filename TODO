* Replace the current ID3 lib with [taglib-ruby](https://github.com/robinst/taglib-ruby)
* Derive nice-looking HTML templates from Wordpress' Twenty Eleven theme. Potentially add disqus widgets and a Flattr button for demo purposes.
* Print warnings when one of the specs from http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html is violated
* Allow muting of the iTunes warnings (see above) using a commandline switch
* Implement sidecar files
* Write up some documentation on how the mapping between ID3 tags, iTunes and channel / item attributes works
* Support other file types than mp3 (e.g. ogg or pdf)
* Treat lyrics as plain text for the episode page, and with an optional command line switch we could also support markdown etc.
* Potential optimization for large numbers of mp3 files: If there is an existing index.rss file, do not re-read the information from those files that are still there and still have the same hash value.
* It feels pretty awkward to refer to the ID3v2 frame names all the time. After all, this is an implementation detail. Maybe we can wrap the frames with a nicer name, but still allow access to the underlying mp3info library? Maybe all we need is some aliasing and / or delegation?
* Potentially replace the ERB template with Builder::XmlMarkup, see http://builder.rubyforge.org/ (the same that Rails uses)
* Improve handling of iTunes' normalization data. ```id3info test/fixtures/iTunes.mp3``` shows that comments do have a key, and we want to skip iTunNORM.
* Expose strip_itunes_private as commandline parameter
* Write up a man page so that [gem man](http://defunkt.io/gem-man/) can pick it up
